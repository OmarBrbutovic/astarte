‚ö° Trigger Engine (te)
==============================

Trigger Engine takes care of processing Triggers. It is a purely computational
component which handles every Trigger's pipeline and triggers actions
accordingly.

## üîß Build

to build dup you can follow the usual elixir flow

``` shell
mix deps.get
mix compile
```

to lint dup code and get some insights on pattern matching and typing you can
run dialyzer.

``` shell
mix dialyzer
```

nb: all PRs have to be linter-approved, so running `mix dialyzer` before makeing
a pull request saves everyone some precious review time!

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Test

to test dup you need a running instance of rabbitmq and a cassandra-compatible
database, (we suggest scylla)

``` shell
docker run --rm -d -p 9042:9042 --name scylla scylladb/scylla
docker run --rm  -d -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 --name rabbit rabbitmq:3.12.0-management
```

by default `RABBITMQ_HOST` and `CASSANDRA_NODES` environment variables map to
`localhost`, so that

``` shell
mix test
```

just works. In more complex scenarios you might need to tell to astarte where
these resources are located.

``` shell
RABBITMQ_HOST=localhost CASSANDRA_NODES=localhost mix test
```
